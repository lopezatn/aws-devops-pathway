# aws-sysdev-pathway

I built this repository to document my Cloud and Site Reliability Engineering career.  
After a year of learning programming, I shifted focus to mastering AWS and automation — skills directly aligned with modern infrastructure roles like SysDev, DevOps, and SRE.  

Every phase in this roadmap follows a real-world workflow:  
- scripting and automation in Python with boto3,  
- deploying and securing EC2 environments,  
- managing infrastructure with CloudFormation and Terraform,  
- and implementing monitoring and reliability practices using AWS native tools.  

My goal is to build both the technical foundation and a public record of progress — showing consistent hands-on learning, version control habits, and professional documentation.
