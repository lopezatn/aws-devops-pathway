# AWS SysDev Pathway

## Purpose
This repository contains hands-on cloud and systems labs focused on understanding how AWS-based infrastructure behaves in real operational scenarios.  
It complements my main infrastructure portfolio by exploring smaller, isolated problems related to automation, access control, networking, and reliability.  
The goal is to build intuition around cloud operations by implementing, testing, and troubleshooting focused system components using Linux and AWS services.

## What This Repository Is
- A collection of **practical systems and operations labs**
- Focused on **how cloud infrastructure behaves**, not on tutorials
- Used to experiment with **automation, access patterns, and operational workflows**
- Designed to reflect **real-world SysDev / DevOps responsibilities at a junior level**

This repository is intentionally lab-oriented rather than production-grade.

## Areas Explored
- AWS automation using Bash and Python
- Linux-based EC2 environments and access control
- IAM roles, permissions, and security boundaries
- Infrastructure management with Terraform and CloudFormation
- Monitoring, logging, and basic reliability practices using AWS native tools

## Example Labs
Labs in this repository include:
- Automating dynamic IP handling and security group updates
- AWS Lambda functions for operational tasks such as EBS snapshot automation
- Self-hosted Linux services with DNS and basic networking configuration
- Small experiments focused on troubleshooting and observability

## How This Fits the Portfolio
- **portfolio-infrastructure** represents an end-to-end, cohesive system
- **aws-sysdev-pathway** focuses on isolated operational problems and learning labs

Together, they show both **system-level thinking** and **hands-on operational depth**.

## Next Improvements
- Consolidate selected labs into reusable automation modules
- Expand monitoring and alerting scenarios
- Add CI/CD validation for infrastructure and automation scripts
